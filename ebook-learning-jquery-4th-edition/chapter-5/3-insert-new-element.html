		<p class="square">Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself belong) and Five-Sided Figures or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon">Pentagons
		</a>.
	</p>
	<p class="nobility hexagon">Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees, beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon">Hexagons</a>, and from thence rising in the number of their sides till
		they receive the honourable title of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon">Polygonal</a>, or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides becomes so numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot be distinguished from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle">circle</a>, he
		is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.

	<p><span class="pull-quote">It is a <span class="drop">Law of Nature</span> with us that a male child shall have <strong>one more side</strong> than his father</span>, so that each <span class="footnote">Generation shall rise (as a rule) </span>one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.

	<p>How admirable is the Law of Compensation! <span class="footnote">And how perfect a proof of the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the aristocratic constitution of the States of Flatland!</span> By a judicious use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.&hellip;
