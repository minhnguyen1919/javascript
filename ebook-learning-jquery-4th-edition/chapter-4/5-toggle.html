		<p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
			on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
			and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
			created equal.
		</p>
		<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
			that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
			can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of
			that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
			field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
			their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether
			fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a
			larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
			we cannot hallow, this ground.
